# Swish [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Nothing but net(working).

Swish is a networking library that is particularly meant for requesting and
decoding JSON via [Argo](http://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo). It is protocol
based, and so aims to be easy to test and customize.
